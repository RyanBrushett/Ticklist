Ticklist
========

Play! framework test to make a rock climbing ticklist application.

TODO:
1) Crag location page.
2) Boulders filter-by Crag.

NOTES:
1) Modeling mistake: ALWAYS use Long id for id's rather than the name.
   A property of the climb/location that may need to be edited after
   the fact should NOT be the ID. Rookie mistake.
