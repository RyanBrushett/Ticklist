Ticklist
========

Play! framework test to make a rock climbing ticklist application.

TODO:

1) Priority 1 at this point is to clean up the models.
In writing everything hastily, I managed to completely muck up the models
from the way I intended.

I'd like to have people on boulders and routes, and routes and boulders at
crags.

Instead I've somehow managed to end up with people at crags and crags not really
doing anything and then people having sent or not sent boulders.

Poor planning on my part.
