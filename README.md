Ticklist
========

Play! framework test to make a rock climbing ticklist application.

TODO:

1) I'm going to move Crag creation to its own page called Locations.
2) Each Location should have a link to filter the boulder list by itself.
3) A user should be able to create a location from there*

* Still working on this shit. I want it to be thru a form.
