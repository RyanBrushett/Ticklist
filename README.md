Ticklist
========

Play! framework test to make a rock climbing ticklist application.

TODO:

1) Need to add Tick and Undo functionality.

2) Need to add Create/Delete Boulder.
   Have added an Add Boulder page


NOTES:

1) Modeling mistake: ALWAYS use Long id for id's rather than the name.
   A property of the climb/location that may need to be edited after
   the fact should NOT be the ID. Terrible rookie mistake but a good
   thing to learn early before I get into anything important.

2) Coffeescript is not fun. I'd rather write AJAX myself and I think
   I will from now on. I don't know if there's any remaining artifacts
   from trying to use Coffeescript in this application but if there
   is, be assured I have no intention for it to be there.
