Ticklist
========

Play! framework test to make a rock climbing ticklist application.

TODO:

1) I think I've fixed the models and fixed up all of the application tests. Everything clears so now I'd like
to start on the UI

2) If the UI goes well, I'd like to start styling the landing page.

3) Add functionality like adding boulders, ticking them off, etc.
